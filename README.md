## Clean Architecture with NET 9

## Description

Although I haven’t published a previous article on this topic, I’ve had the opportunity to work on several real-world projects — many of them based in the United States — where we implemented microservices using [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) principles.

I have over 10 years of experience working with .NET, from its .NET Framework versions to the first release of .NET Core, which I continue to use today under its current name, .NET 9.

I have found .NET to be the ideal platform for building structured, scalable, and maintainable applications. Its strong type system, mature ecosystem, and powerful tooling provide a solid foundation for delivering enterprise-grade solutions.

Coming from a background that values SOLID principles and object-oriented design, it has been natural to apply those principles when designing services, use cases, and domain models in .NET.

Like any architectural approach, Clean Architecture involves trade-offs. It’s important to strike the right balance — avoiding unnecessary complexity or over-abstraction, while maintaining flexibility and a clear separation of concerns.

In my projects, I have applied the concepts proposed by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and combined them with ideas from Hexagonal Architecture, Onion Architecture, and Screaming Architecture. The goal has always been to make the application resilient to change, especially given how often client requirements evolve — which, as we all know, is a certainty in software development.


## About the project

The purpose of the sample project I am submitting is to provide an online loan management system, enabling loans to be paid back in monthly installments. The system allows users to register borrowers and monitor their repayment progress.
